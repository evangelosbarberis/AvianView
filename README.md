# AvianView
AvianView is a bird-watching web application that allows users to track and visualize bird sightings through interactive maps, species-specific checklists, and detailed location and personal statistics. The app enables bird watchers to log their observations, explore bird densities across regions, and gain insights into their birding activities through intuitive Vue.js-powered pages that include features like map-based sighting tracking, species selection, and personalized bird-watching filters.

## Brief Rundown 
This project was developed as part of a course at the University of California, Santa Cruz, focusing on practical applications of Database Management, UI/UX Design, Web Frameworks, Agile Software Development, and Web Application Architecture. We created a comprehensive bird-watching application that enables users to register, track, edit, and manage their bird sightings through an interactive platform featuring integrated mapping, data visualization, and personalized user statistics that can be dynamically updated and stored in the database.

The database we implemented was based around CSV files, and had a key word search in Models.py, and information was controlled by the controllers.py (Look for specifc guidlines and detials in the application files).

## Functionality

### Index
![INDEX](Images/Index.png)

Greet users with an intuitive and visually compelling index page that showcases regional bird statistics through an interactive heat map displaying bird sighting densities across different areas. Users can seamlessly register for an account and explore our designed interface, which offers an engaging and informative bird-watching experience.
### Enter Checklist
Once officially signed in, users are welcomed to a comprehensive checklist page where they can effortlessly document bird sightings with precise details. The interface automatically captures location and timestamp information through user location permissions, allowing users to seamlessly add multiple bird observations to their checklist with intuitive data entry capabilities.

After submitting their checklist, users can explore their personalized statistics through interactive, data-driven visualizations that provide insights into their bird-watching activities. The statistics page offers a comprehensive, searchable interface allowing users to dive deep into their recorded species, with the ability to filter and analyze their bird sightings with ease.

### Location details

The location page serves as a comprehensive exploration hub for users curious about specific bird or regional details. Users can dive into detailed statistical visualizations through interactive bar graphs, while a competitive leaderboard enables birding enthusiasts to compare and track their sighting accomplishments across different locations.

As users scroll down, they'll discover an additional layer of insights through an informative pie chart that breaks down observation times and highlights the most frequently observed species in the selected location.

For users seeking detailed insights into a specific species, the search feature offers an unparalleled exploration experience. By selecting a species, users are immediately presented with a comprehensive view featuring a top density map and a time-based graph of sightings, revealing intricate patterns in bird population and movementâ€”arguably the page's most compelling feature.
